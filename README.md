# Reinforcement_Learning_Mario_bros

To play
super mario bros version 2 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
been used to train agents to play. The agents are trained using
different state representations and learning algorithms and their
performances are evaluated using metrics such as Avg. Reward,
Avg. Q-Value, Avg. Game Score, Avg. Steps Per Episode, and
Training and Test Times. The main goal of solving reinforcement
learning problems is to choose the best course of action to take
in each situation in order to maximise the reward. However,
unlike other forms of machine learning, the learning system
is not given instructions on what to do
